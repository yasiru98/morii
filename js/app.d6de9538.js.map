If you're lucky, you'll catch a second line parade strutting through the crowds. But this city isn't all Sazerac in a Solo cup. Take in the scenery of the historic French Quarter, tour the elegant Garden District, and eat your way across Nola's incredible restaurants and cafes—beignets are a must. If you love stories about things that go bump in the night, book a guided ghost tour that weaves through local taverns, alleyways, and cemeteries.\",\r\n    \"\",\r\n    [{\r\n        id: \"1\",\r\n        src: picture1,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 1\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"2\",\r\n        src: picture2,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 2\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"3\",\r\n        src: picture3,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 3\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"4\",\r\n        src: picture4,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 4\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"5\",\r\n        src: picture5,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 5\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"6\",\r\n        src: picture6,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 6\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"7\",\r\n        src: picture7,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 7\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"8\",\r\n        src: picture8,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 8\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"9\",\r\n        src: picture9,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 9\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"10\",\r\n        src: picture10,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 10\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"11\",\r\n        src: picture11,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 11\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"12\",\r\n        src: picture12,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 12\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"13\",\r\n        src: picture13,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 9\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"14\",\r\n        src: picture14,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 10\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"15\",\r\n        src: picture15,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 11\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"16\",\r\n        src: picture16,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 12\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"17\",\r\n        src: picture17,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 1\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"18\",\r\n        src: picture18,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 2\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"19\",\r\n        src: picture19,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 3\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"20\",\r\n        src: picture20,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 4\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"21\",\r\n        src: picture21,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 5\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"22\",\r\n        src: picture22,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 6\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"23\",\r\n        src: picture23,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 7\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"24\",\r\n        src: picture24,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 8\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"25\",\r\n        src: picture25,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 9\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"26\",\r\n        src: picture26,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 10\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"27\",\r\n        src: picture27,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 11\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"28\",\r\n        src: picture28,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 12\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"29\",\r\n        src: picture29,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 9\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"30\",\r\n        src: picture30,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 10\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"31\",\r\n        src: picture31,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 11\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"32\",\r\n        src: picture32,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 12\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"33\",\r\n        src: picture33,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 1\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"34\",\r\n        src: picture34,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 2\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"35\",\r\n        src: picture35,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 3\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"36\",\r\n        src: picture36,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 3\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"37\",\r\n        src: picture37,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 4\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"38\",\r\n        src: picture38,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 4\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"39\",\r\n        src: picture39,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 5\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"40\",\r\n        src: picture40,\r\n        alt: \"Alt Image 6\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"\",\r\n    newMaterial\r\n  );\r\n  let moriis = newMemorii;\r\n  store.commit(\"updateMoriis\", {\r\n    moriis: moriis\r\n  });\r\n\r\n\r\n  let newMemorii2 = new Memorii(\r\n    \"Spring Break!\",\r\n    \"May 2020\",\r\n    [\"Jake\", \"Liza\", \"John\"],\r\n    \"West Palm Beach, FL\",\r\n    \"Florida’s spring break debacle — rowdy COVID super-spreader crowds at beaches around the state, at some spots with violence thrown in for special effect — is the perfect showcase for what ails the state’s governor: recurring poor judgment.

Strange lands, exciting places, and new cultures have always fascinated me. I've always wondered what it would be like to speak another language, to grow up learning different customs, or to live in a completely different way than I do now. This past summer my dream finally came true. I got to travel to England, France, Switzerland, and Germany with Mme. Kelly and five other girls, and suddenly the world was at my fingertips. England's green hills and city life is unforgettable. Kensington, Westminster Abby, and Piccadelli Circus are just a few parts of London full of historic cathedrals, quaint little cafes, and amazing shopping places. Harrods, where the royal family shops, supposedly sales any and everything. My favorite experience in London was riding The Underground to see the broadway play Fosse and watching the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace.
